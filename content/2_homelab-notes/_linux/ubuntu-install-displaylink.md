## Driver

The [guide on displaylink.com](https://support.displaylink.com/knowledgebase/articles/684649-how-to-install-displaylink-software-on-ubuntu) for Ubuntu works. Also tested on Mint 19.3 Tricia.

## Hiccups
The one snag I ran into was it got stuck on the `Building EVDI kernel module with DKMS` step. [See how I resolved that here](ubuntu-dkms-error.html)
