## Overview

The *User Journey* (or Customer Journey) illustrates the journey a customer takes when using your product, typically represented as a chart but can be done in a table. The most common journey that's modelled is the new user acquisition flow (some variation of: awareness --> evaluation --> purchase --> retention --> advocacy) but the concept can be applied to any user flow in the product.

User Journeys aren't limited to B2C products or to websites/landing pages, they could also be applied to experiences like 'Creating service desk tickets in Slack'.

User Journey's can be created for each [persona](2022-08-16_personas.md), this helps identify how different groups of people engage with the product.
